# M&A Integration Simulator: Human-AI Collaboration for Smarter Due Diligence

Core Idea:
An AI-driven platform that simulates post-merger integration scenarios using real-world data patterns, combining Agentic AI, HITL validation, and PostgreSQL + vector databases to create actionable insights during due diligence.

Goal:
Enable companies to “test” how a target company could integrate into their ecosystem — identifying cultural, technical, and operational risks before acquisition.
