# M&A Integration Simulator: Human-AI Collaboration for Smarter Due Diligence

üß† **Overview**

M&A Integration Simulator leverages agentic AI and human-in-the-loop (HITL) learning to model how two companies might integrate after a merger. The platform analyzes data across cultural, technical, and operational dimensions to simulate post-merger outcomes and highlight potential risks.

Goal: Enable companies to ‚Äútest‚Äù how a target company could integrate into their ecosystem ‚Äî identifying cultural, technical, and operational risks before acquisition.

Built for the intersection of AI, data science, and corporate strategy, this project blends AI-driven scenario modeling with human oversight to deliver responsible, explainable insights that support better acquisition decisions.
